import {AdditionalInformation, Image, ListItem, JavaPlusJsHeader, Warning} from '../../src/components';

<div className='mb-12'>
<Warning>

**Please note that at the moment:** <br/>
– This demo works only for Windows 10. <br/>
– Frontend JavaScript coverage collection for automated tests works only when running headful Chrome.

<JavaPlusJsHeader/>

## Step 1. Clone the example repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Drill4J/realworld-java-and-js-coverage
cd realworld-java-and-js-coverage
```

## Step 2. Start Drill4J Admin

<ListItem number={'2.1.'}>Start docker containers using the following command:</ListItem>

```
./demo-up.sh
```

<ListItem number={'2.2.'}>

After the installation go to Drill4J Admin: [http://localhost:8091](http://localhost:8091)

</ListItem>

<ListItem number={'2.3.'}>

Press “Continue as a Guest” and **register agents** (both Java and Node.js)

</ListItem>

<Image src={'/img/java-plus-js-agents-table.png'}/>

<ListItem number={'2.4.'}>

Go through the first two steps of the registration wizard and make sure that Test2Code plugin is **enabled** at Step 3

<Warning>

**Important!** Don't forget to set target host "http://localhost:8080/" on the second step for Node.js agent. It is necessary to collect manual coverage via extension.

</Warning>

</ListItem>

<ListItem number={'2.5.'}>

Open sample application at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

</ListItem>

<ListItem number={'2.6.'}>

To collect coverage run tests:

</ListItem>

```
./gradlew clean :build1:test
```

Tests will be started in a few seconds. Please wait untill the testing process finish. <br/>
See the testing results on [Test2Code plugin’s page](http://localhost:8091/service-group-full-page/realworld-app/test2code) and **finish active scope** <br/>
to add collected coverage to your build.


## Step 3. Deploy additional builds

You have to deploy additional builds to discover Drill4J features:

* Tests to run;
* Risks Management;
* Time Savings;
* Baseline builds.

<ListItem number={'3.1.'}>

Deploy the **2nd build** of Realworld example app:

</ListItem>

```
./demo-deploy-build2.sh
```
<AdditionalInformation >

Wait for build notification to appear (click the icon in the top-right corner).

</AdditionalInformation>

Now you are able to see the list of **Risks** (uncovered new and modified methods) <br/>
and suggested **Tests to Run**

<ListItem number={'3.2.'}>

To collect coverage for the 2nd build run tests:

</ListItem>

```
./gradlew clean :build2:test
```

<ListItem number={'3.3.'}>

Deploy the **3rd build** (optional):

</ListItem>

```
./demo-deploy-build3.sh
```

<ListItem number={'3.4.'}>

To collect coverage for the 3rd build run tests:

</ListItem>

```
./gradlew clean :build3:test
```
Below you can find a command to **remove** RealWorld demo example:

```
./demo-down.sh
```
