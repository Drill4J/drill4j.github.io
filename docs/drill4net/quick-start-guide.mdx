This quick start guide describes how to get started with Drill4Net.
For CI/CD integration see <Link to="/docs/drill4net/ci-cd-integration" target="_blank">this guide</Link>.

## 1. Perform One Time Setup
Perform a <Link to="/docs/drill4net/one-time-setup" target="_blank">one time setup</Link> before you continue with this guide.

## 2. Run Drill4Net Injector
After *application under test* and project with tests are built <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-apps#4-usage-1" target="_blank">run Drill4Net Injector</Link>.

<Warning>
    Make sure that <i>application under test</i> assembly and <i>assembly with tests</i> are <b>not</b> rebuilt
    before running tests. <i>Drill4Net Scanner</i> and <i>Drill4Net Injector</i> make some important modifications 
    to the assembly to make Drill4Net solution work. 
</Warning>

## 3. Explore Coverage
1. Run your tests from assembly provided to *Drill4Net Injector*.
2. A green circle with a checkmark inside should appear next to the agent icon in the *Drill4J Admin*, indicating that the agent
is active.

3. Now you can explore covered methods and their associated tests, information about each tests, and coverage percent.

## 4. Explore New Build Coverage and Risks
Let's say the development team made some modifications to *application under test* code an the new build is ready.
1. Simply <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-apps#4-usage" target="_blank">run Drill4Net Scanner</Link> for new build
but this time change value of `adminAgentConfig:buildVersion` in appsettings.yml to new build version value
(any value that differs from previous build version).
2. You should see the upadated information about coverage along with *Risks* (method modified since last build) and
*Tests to run* (tests that should run to cover risks).

## 5. Cover Risks
1. <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-apps#4-usage-1" target="_blank">Run Drill4Net Injector</Link> for a new <i>assembly with tests</i> build.
2. Run your tests from assembly provided to *Drill4Net Injector*. Change value of `AdminAgentConfig:BuildVersion` in
drill4netsettings.yml to new build version value (the same version, you specified for Drill4Net Scanner in previous step).
3. Now you can see that the *risks* are covered with tests.
