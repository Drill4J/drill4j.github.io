This quick start guide describes how to get started with Drill4Net.
For CI/CD integration see <Link to="./ci-cd-integration" target="_blank">this guide</Link>.

## 1. Perform One Time Setup
Perform a <Link to="./one-time-setup" target="_blank">one time setup</Link> before you continue with this guide.

## 2. Run Drill4Net Injector
Run Drill4Net.Injector.App for current build. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe
```
You can also provide `TestAssemblySourcePath` argument. In this case, value from drill4netsettings.yml will be overriden. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest.Tests\netcoreapp3.1\AppUnderTest.Tests.dll"
```

## 3. Run Integration Tests
1. Run your integration tests from assembly provided to *Test Agent*. Note that tests should run only after Drill4Net.Injector.App run is
successfully finsihed. Now make sure the assembly with tests is not rebuilt before running tests.
2. A green circle with a checkmark inside should appear next to the agent icon in the *Drill4J Admin*, indicating that the agent
is active.

5. Now you can explore covered methods and their associated tests, information about each tests, and coverage percent.

## 4. Run Drill4Net Scanner for New Build
1. Modify some methods of application under test. 
2. Make sure application under test is rebuilt.
3. <Link to="./one-time-setup#7-run-drill4net-scanner" target="_blank">Run Drill4Net Scanner</Link> but this time change value of `adminAgentConfig:buildVersion` in appsettings.yml
to new build version value (any value that differs from previous build version).
4. You should see the upadated information about coverage along with *Risks* (method modified since last build) and
*Tests to run* (tests that should run to cover risks). You can also use `GET` request to retrieve suggested tests to run.
To do this click *Get Suggested Tests*. You can copy `curl` command to clipboard.

## 5. Run Integration Tests for New Build
1. Make sure integration tests assembly is rebuilt.
2. [Run Drill4Net Injector](#2-run-drill4net-injector).
3. Run your integration tests from assembly provided to *Test Agent*. Note that tests should run only after Drill4Net.Injector.App run is
successfully finsihed. Now make sure the assembly with tests is not rebuilt before running tests.
4. Now the *risks* are covered with tests and no *risks* are present, while previous ones are covered.
