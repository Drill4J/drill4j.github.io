This quick guide describes how to get started with Drill4Net.
For CI/CD integration see [this guide](./ci-cd-integration).

## 1. Install Required NuGet Packages
1. Install [Drill4Net.Receiver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.Receiver) in application under test start up project.
2. Install [Drill4Net.Receiver.WebApi](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.Receiver.WebApi) in application under test start up project.
3. Install [Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit) or [Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit)
in *assembly with tests* based on test framework used in your *assembly with tests*.

## 2. Install Drill4J Admin
First of all you need to install *Drill4J Admin*. Follow [this guide](./../installation/drill-admin)
to see the different installation ways and find the right one for you.

## 3. Run Test Agent
1. Download *Test Agent* for [Windows](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases/download/v1.0.0/drill4net-injector-app-win-x64.zip) or 
[Linux](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases/download/v1.0.0/drill4net-injector-app-linux-x64.zip).
2. Configure *Test Agent* as described [here](./configuration#test-agent-configuration).
3. Run Drill4Net.Injector.App. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe
```
You can also provide `TestAssemblySourcePath` argument. In this case, value from drill4netsettings.yml will be overriden. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest.Tests\netcoreapp3.1\Ipreo.XUnit.Tests.dll"
```

## 4. Run Drill4Net Scanner
1. Make sure Drill4Net Admin is up and running.
2. Download *Test Agent* for [Windows](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases/download/v1.0.0/drill4net-scanner-win-x64.zip) or 
[Linux](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases/download/v1.0.0/drill4net-scanner-linux-x64.zip).
3. Configure *Drill4Net Scanner* as described [here](./configuration#drill4net-scanner-configuration).
4. Run Drill4Net.Scanner. There are two required arguments: 
- Directory with binaries of application under test
- Application under test executable (`--target`)
Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Scanner.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1" \
  --target "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\Paralel.exe"
```
5. There are also optional parameters described [here](./drill4net-scanner-parameters).

## 5. Register Agent in Drill4J Admin
1. After you launched *Drill4Net Scanner*, navigate to *Drill4J Admin UI*.
2. Click *Select Agent* --> *Add Agent*
3. You should see agent with name specified in `adminAgentConfig:id` earlier and .NET type. Click *Register*.

4. Now you can see your agent information. Click *Next*.

5. Enter arbirtary value in *Target Host* field. This value will not make any effect. This field was made for Java and JavaScript agents.
In future we are going to implement autoregistration, so this field is not required for .NET Agent. Simply click *Next*.

6. Check *Test2Code* and click *Finish*.
<Image src="/img/drill4net/agent-registration-03.png"/>
7. Now you can select newly created agent and go to *Test2Code*. You should see your class structure:
<Image src="/img/drill4net/test2code-01.png"/>
The full agent registration process should look like this:

</details>

## 6. Run Integration Tests
1. Run your integration tests from assembly provided to *Test Agent*. Note that tests should run only after Drill4Net.Injector.App run is
successfully finsihed. Now make sure the assembly with tests is not rebuilt before running tests.
2. A green circle with a checkmark inside should appear next to the agent icon in the *Drill4J Admin*, indicating that the agent
is active.

5. Now you can explore covered methods and their associated tests, information about each tests, and coverage percent.

## 7. Run Drill4Net Scanner for New Build
1. Modify some methods of application under test. 
2. Make sure application under test is rebuilt.
3. [Run Drill4Net Scanner](#4-run-drill4net-scanner) but this time change value of `adminAgentConfig:buildVersion` in appsettings.yml
to new build version value (any value that differs from previous build version).
4. You should see the upadated information about coverage along with *Risks* (method modified since last build) and
*Tests to run* (tests that should run to cover risks). You can also use `GET` request to retrieve suggested tests to run.
To do this click *Get Suggested Tests*. You can copy `curl` command to clipboard.

</details>

## 8. Run Integration Tests for New Build
1. Make sure integration tests assembly is rebuilt.
2. [Run Test Agent](#3-run-test-agent).
3. Run your integration tests from assembly provided to *Test Agent*. Note that tests should run only after Drill4Net.Injector.App run is
successfully finsihed. Now make sure the assembly with tests is not rebuilt before running tests.
4. Now the *risks* are covered with tests and no *risks* are present, while previous ones are covered.
