## Perform Agent One Time Setup
Perform an <Link to="./one-time-setup" target="_blank">agent one time setup</Link> before you continue with this guide.

<Info>
    NOTE <br/>
    If you are going to perform <b>only manual</b> tests you can safely ignore any steps from one time setup that are related 
    to <i>Drill4J Injector</i>. In the case of manual tests there is no need to process <i>assembly with tests</i>, which is 
    the responsibility of <i>Drill4Net Injector</i>.
