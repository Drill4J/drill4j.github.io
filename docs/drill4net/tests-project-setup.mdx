in *assembly with tests* based on test framework used in your *assembly with tests*.

## Selenium Tests Setup
1. Install [Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit) or [Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit)
in *assembly with tests* based on test framework used in your *assembly with tests*.
2. Install [Drill4Net.Selenium](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.Selenium) in *assembly with tests*.
3. Add `UseDrill4Net` extention method call for Selenium web driver. Example:
```
var driver = new ChromeDriver().UseDrill4Net();
```
Make sure you added `using Drill4Net.Selenium.Drill4NetDriver;`.

## Playwright Tests Setup
1. Install [Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit) or [Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit)
in *assembly with tests* based on test framework used in your *assembly with tests*.
2. Install [Drill4Net.Playwright](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.Playwright) in *assembly with tests*.
