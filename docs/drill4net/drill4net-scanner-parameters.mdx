title: Drill4Net Scanner Parameters
---

## Example
```
Drill4Net.Scanner.exe <path that contains executable file> --target <path to executable file> --exclude "[coverlet.*]Coverlet.Core.Coverage"
```
Drill4Net goes a step in the other direction by also letting you explicitly set what can be included using the `--include` option.  

Examples
```
--include "[*]*" - Includes all types in all assemblies (everything is instrumented)
--include "[coverlet.*]Coverlet.Core.Coverage" - Includes the Coverage class in the Coverlet.Core namespace belonging to any assembly that matches coverlet.* (e.g coverlet.core)
--include "[coverlet.*.tests?]*" - Includes all types in any assembly starting with coverlet. and ending with .test or .tests (the ? makes the s optional)
```
Both `--exclude` and `--include` options can be used together but `--exclude` takes precedence. You can specify the `--exclude` and `--include` options multiple times to allow for multiple filter expressions.
You can also include coverage of the test assembly itself by specifying the `--include-test-assembly` flag.

## Optional Parameters

There are some optional parameters to which you can provide arguments in *Drill4Net Scanner*
```
  --exclude                 Filter expressions to exclude specific modules and types.
  --include                 Filter expressions to include only specific modules and types.
  --exclude-by-file         Glob patterns specifying source files to exclude.
  --include-directory       Include directories containing additional assemblies to be instrumented.
  --exclude-by-attribute    Attributes to exclude from code coverage.
  --include-test-assembly   Specifies whether to report code coverage of the test assembly.
```
NB. For multiple value options, you have to specify values multiple times i.e.
```
--exclude-by-attribute 'Obsolete' --exclude-by-attribute'GeneratedCode' --exclude-by-attribute 'CompilerGenerated'
```
## Filters
Dill4Net gives the ability to have fine-grained control over what gets excluded using *filter expressions*.
Syntax: `--exclude '[Assembly-Filter]Type-Filter'`
Wildcards
- \* - matches zero or more characters
- ? - the prefixed character is optional

Examples
```
--exclude "[*]*" - Excludes all types in all assemblies (nothing is instrumented)
--exclude "[coverlet.*]Coverlet.Core.Coverage" - Excludes the Coverage class in the Coverlet.Core namespace belonging to any assembly that matches coverlet.* (e.g coverlet.core)
--exclude "[*]Coverlet.Core.Instrumentation.*" - Excludes all types belonging to Coverlet.Core.Instrumentation namespace in any assembly
--exclude "[coverlet.*.tests?]*" - Excludes all types in any assembly starting with coverlet. and ending with .test or .tests (the ? makes the s optional)
--exclude "[coverlet.*]*" --exclude "[*]Coverlet.Core*" - Excludes assemblies matching coverlet.* and excludes all types belonging to the Coverlet.Core namespace in any assembly
--exclude "[coverlet.core]Coverlet.Core.Coverage" - Excludes the Coverage class in the Coverlet.Core namespace belonging to coverlet.core assembly
```
