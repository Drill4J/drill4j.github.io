The Drill4Net agent should run after the build step in CI/CD pipeline:
<Image src="/img/drill4net/drill4net-build-pipeline.svg"/>

## 1. One Time Setup

### 1.1. Install Required NuGet Packages
1. Install [Drill4Net.Receiver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.Receiver) in *application under test* start up project.
2. Install [Drill4Net.Receiver.WebApi](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.Receiver.WebApi) in *application under test* start up project.
3. Install [Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.NUnit) or [Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Drill4Net.TestAgent.XUnit)
in *assembly with tests* based on test framework used in your *assembly with tests*.

### 1.2. Use Drill4Net Middleware
Add the following line in you `Startup.Configure` method:
```
app.UseDrill4NetReceiverWebApi();
``` 
Make sure you added `using Drill4Net.Receiver.WebApi;`.

### 1.3. Install Drill4J Admin
First of all you need to install *Drill4J Admin*. Follow [this guide](./drill4j-admin-installation)
to see the different installation ways and find the right one for you.

### 1.4. Configure Test Agent
1. Download *Test Agent (drill4net-injector-app)* for your system [here](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
2. Configure *Test Agent* as described [here](./configuration#test-agent-configuration).

### 1.5. Build Application Under Test
Build application under tests, so you can proceed with following steps

### 1.6. Run Drill4Net Scanner
You need to run *Drill4Net Scanner* to prepare application under tests.
1. Make sure Drill4Net Admin is up and running.
2. Download *Drill4Net Scanner (drill4net-scanner)* for your system [here](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
3. Configure *Drill4Net Scanner* as described [here](./configuration#drill4net-scanner-configuration).
4. Run Drill4Net.Scanner. There are two required arguments:
- Directory with binaries of application under test
- Application under test executable (`--target`)
Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Scanner.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1" \
  --target "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\Paralel.exe"
```
5. There are also optional parameters described [here](./drill4net-scanner-parameters).

### 1.7. Register Agent in Drill4J Admin
1. After you launched *Drill4Net Scanner*, navigate to *Drill4J Admin UI*.
2. Click *Select Agent* --> *Add Agent*
3. You should see agent with name specified in `adminAgentConfig:id` earlier and .NET type. Click *Register*.
<Image src="/img/drill4net/add-agent.png"/>
4. Now you can see your agent information. Click *Next*.
<Image src="/img/drill4net/agent-registration-01.png"/>
5. Enter arbirtary value in *Target Host* field. This value will not make any effect. This field was made for Java and JavaScript agents.
In future we are going to implement autoregistration, so this field is not required for .NET Agent. Simply click *Next*.
<Image src="/img/drill4net/agent-registration-02.png"/>
6. Check *Test2Code* and click *Finish*.
<Image src="/img/drill4net/agent-registration-03.png"/>
7. Now you can select newly created agent and go to *Test2Code*. You should see your class structure:
<Image src="/img/drill4net/test2code-01.png"/>
The full agent registration process should look like this:

## 2. Integrate in CI/CD Pipeline

Now you can integrate Drill4Net in CI/CD pipeline. Perform the following steps after the build step is finished.

### 2.1. Change Build Version in Configurations
Each build should change build version in *Test Agent* and *Drill4Net Scanner* appsettings.yml.
1. Change `adminAgentConfig:buildVersion` in *Drill4Net Scanner* appsettings.yml to version of current build.
2. Change `AdminAgentConfig:BuildVersion` in *Test Agent* drill4netsettings.yml to version of current build.

### 2.2. Run Drill4Net Scanner
[Run Drill4Net Scanner](#16-run-drill4net-scanner) for current build.

### 2.3. Run Test Agent
Run Drill4Net.Injector.App for current build. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe
```
You can also provide `TestAssemblySourcePath` argument. In this case, value from drill4netsettings.yml will be overriden. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest.Tests\netcoreapp3.1\Ipreo.XUnit.Tests.dll"
```

### 2.4. Run Integration Tests
Run your integration tests from assembly provided to *Test Agent*. Note that tests should run only after Drill4Net.Injector.App run is
successfully finsihed. Make sure you run tests without rebuilding before running tests.

### 2.5. Get Suggested Tests to Run
You can execute the `curl` command to get suggested tests to run:
```
curl -i -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -X GET {drill4j-address}/api/agents/{agent-id}/plugins/test2code/data/tests-to-run
```
`drill4j-address` is the address of *Drill4J Admin*, for example `http://localhost:8091`.

`agent-id` is the value of `adminAgentConfig:id` provided in *Drill4Net Scanner* earlier.
