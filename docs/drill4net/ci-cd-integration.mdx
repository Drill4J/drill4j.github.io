## Prerequisites
Perform a <Link to="./one-time-setup" target="_blank">one time setup</Link> before you continue with CI/CD integration.

## CI/CD Integration

The Drill4Net agent should run after the build step in CI/CD pipeline:
<Image src="/img/drill4net/drill4net-build-pipeline.svg"/>

### 1. Update Build Version in Configurations
Each build should update build version in *Drill4Net Scanner* and *Drill4Net Injector* configuration files.
1. Update `adminAgentConfig:buildVersion` in *Drill4Net Scanner* appsettings.yml to version of current build.
2. Update `AdminAgentConfig:BuildVersion` in *Drill4Net Injector* drill4netsettings.yml to version of current build.

### 2. Run Drill4Net Scanner
After each build, you should <Link to="./drill4net-apps#4-usage" target="_blank">run Drill4Net Scanner</Link> for
*application under test* assembly.

### 3. Run Drill4Net Injector
After each build, you should <Link to="./drill4net-apps#4-usage" target="_blank">run Drill4Net Injector</Link> for
*assembly with tests*.

### 4. Run Tests
After *Drill4Net Scanner* and *Drill4Net Injector* finished work, you should run tests from assembly provided to 
*Drill4Net Injector*.

<Warning>
    Make sure that <i>application under test</i> assembly and <i>assembly with tests</i> are <b>not</b> rebuilt before running tests. 
    <i>Drill4Net Scanner</i> and <i>Drill4Net Injector</i> make some important modifications to the assembly to make Drill4Net solution work. 
</Warning>

### 5. Get Tests to Run
You can execute the `curl` command to get tests to run:
```
curl -i -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -X GET {drill4j-address}/api/agents/{agent-id}/plugins/test2code/data/tests-to-run
```
`drill4j-address` is the address of *Drill4J Admin*, for example `http://localhost:8091`.

`agent-id` is the value of `adminAgentConfig:id` provided in *Drill4Net Scanner* earlier.

To cover new build's *Risks* (methods modified since previous build) it is enough to only run tests returned in thr response.
