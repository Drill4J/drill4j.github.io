## 1. Service Packages Configuration
The Drill4J Agent sends the application structure (packages\classes\methods) to the Drill admin panel. <br/>
User is able to configure which service (application) packages will be instrumented. It can be done on the 2nd step of agent registration in the field **Application Packages**.
<Image src="/img/agent-registration-step2.png"/>
User has the ability to exclude unnecessary packages or classes via "!" before the package name. <br/>
The System automatically changes ".", " " to "/". User doesn't have the ability to enter more then one "/" in a row. <br/>
Line with hyphenation turns into an array of strings for backend.

## 2. JaCoCo Instrumentation by Probes
	
Code is instrumented via JaCoCo. Instrumentation allows the Drill4j agent to track code execution during tests. 

### JaCoCo Overview

JaCoCo is a free code coverage library for Java, that calculates coverage by **probes**. <br/>
**Probes** - boolean massive. <br/>
For example: <br/>
**[f,f,f,f,f,f,f.......]**, where **f** - false means that in the process, our thread of execution did not come across a line of code. This probes list exists for each class.
Probes are placed in different places (e.g.):
- at the beginning of the method
- at the beginning of the branch block

### Code Coverage Calculation Algorithm

First, probes are put down with the help of instrumentation in the source code.
When the code is executed, the probe becomes **TRUE** in the boolean massive.
Analysis of all probes and coverage calculation is described in [documentation](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/index.html) <br/>
Bytecode instrumentation is described in [documentation](https://www.baeldung.com/java-instrumentation) 
	
## 3. Context Transmission	
	
Autotest Agent tracks code execution for each test separately and reports these data to Drill4J Admin Backend. <br/> 
It integrates with various [testing frameworks](/docs/supported-frameworks) and configures Selenium to add headers to the HTTP requests. <br/> 
It's necessary to connect a particular test of a User with a Drill4J agent, we need to add additional information in the form of a **User identifier** (session id) and a **test identifier** within HTTP requests. <br/> 
We implement an interceptor for each (supported) client (e.g. Apache, okhttp, Netty) using instrumentation.

## 4. Metrics Calculation	
	
Drill4J Admin Backend calculates the following metrics:
- test coverage 
- associated tests
- covered methods
- risked methods
- recommended tests
- quality gate status

### Risked Methods
**Risked method** is not 100% covered New and/or Modified methods in a new application build. <br/>
**E.g.** in the current build 1000 New methods (200 uncovered), 500 modified (101 uncovered), than risked methods number = 200 + 101 = 301 risked methods. <br/> 
Lambdas aren't displayed as the risked method and not taken in build difference calculation.
A risked method has 3 states:
- not covered 
- partially covered
- fully covered

### Recommended Tests
**Recommended test** is a test that should be run at first to check changes of code in a new build version.
The set of recommended tests is formed by Test to Code mapping. It's a relationship between particular test with the executed part of code.
<Image src="/img/test-to-code-mapping.png"/>

**E.g.**  In the first application build tests are mapped to code. The second application build has 3 modified methods which were covered by 2 test cases (autotests).
Related to this information, we recommend to run only 2 test cases in order to check only modified code and don't waste time to run cases that aren't check something useful. <br/> 
Also, we recommend writing new autotests or modify existing autotests to cover new methods.
