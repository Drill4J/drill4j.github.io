**Why do I need it?** <br/>
Probably, if your project is small and doesn't have a lot of tests, then you don't need it. BUT, if it's a legacy project with a lot of tests, the tool saves your testing time via Test gap analysis and minimizing of regression suite.

**Does Drill work only with JVM?** <br/>
Currently yes, but we're working on .Net agent and JavaScript agent. Python and Ruby agents are also possible in the future.

**Which Java versions do you support?** <br/>
Java 8 - 11 by default. <br/>
Java 12 - 18 started to support in :
- Java Agent [0.8.0-30](https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent/releases/tag/v0.8.0-30)
- Autotest Agent [0.17.8](https://github.com/Drill4J/autotest-agent/releases/tag/v0.17.8)
- Test2code plugin [0.8.0-37](https://github.com/Drill4J/test2code-plugin/releases/tag/v0.8.0-37)

**Can I use Microservice applications?** <br/>
Yes, we're supporting microservice applications. See [Microservices](/docs/installation/microservices)

**Can I use Drill for Android applications?** <br/>
Yes, it is possible, but it's necessary to implement an agent for android application.

**Can I use .war?** <br/>
Yes, but only monolith applications on Tomcat, Jetty, WildFly. Java 8+

**What method of collecting coverage are you using?** <br/>
Probes in bytecode. So, methods can be covered in the range of 0.1 - 100.
Also, we will add the ability to choose a method of coverage collecting. (By string and etc.)

**Which test types do you support?** <br/> - [Manual](/docs/installation/extension)<br/>- [Auto (API, UI)](/docs/installation/autotest-agent)

**How can I specify a backend host for a frontend container?** <br/>
You need to set the **UPSTREAM** env variable for a frontend container.
By default, **UPSTREAM** value is **drill-admin:8090**

**Will information in the DB be saved, if I recreate backend container?** <br/>
Yes, but you need to move the **/work** directory to the volume.

**Where can I find API requests?** <br/>
Swagger is available on port **8090** of backend service. For example, if  Drill frontend and backend parts are installed locally, then swagger is available at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

**What to do if my agent is not displayed in the Drill Admin after connection?** <br/>
Make sure that you use lowercase Latin letters, digits and dashes in the Agent ID parameter.

**What to do if methods\tests in Covered Methods\Associated tests pane are not displayed in active scope?** <br/>
Make sure that the test session is finished (the calculation is done after the test session is finished).

**Does the action continue after closing the modal window?** <br/>
Yes, the operation is performed in the background.

**My application has https connection. Does it suitable case for Drill?** <br/>
Yes, Drill supports https connection. See [HTTPS Setup](/docs/installation/drill-admin#https-setup)

**Do you have prepared Postman collection with API requests?** <br/>
Yes, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Drill4J/example-configs/tree/main/postman)

**When is a method considered new or modified?** <br/>
You can find rules in the table:
