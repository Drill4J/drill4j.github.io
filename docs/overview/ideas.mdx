# Use cases

This page will help you understand if Drill4J fits your project.

We truly believe there is no project that could not benefit from Drill4J.

Lets explore this from multiple standpoints:

- development stage;
- codebase size;
- number of tests;
- maturity of testing processes.

Recipe 1 - reduce manual QA work, avoid needless retesting
Use Drill4J to record manual tests and know exactly what you tested, and if you have something left. And, as a bonus, see the untested areas from the start!

Recipe 2 - speedup lengthy automated tests
Being API or UI, if you tests take more than 10 minutes to complete? You definitely can cut down on that time

Recipe - "Smart smokes"
Use Drill4J to optimize your smoke suite even further - make them both fast and spot-on - cover
