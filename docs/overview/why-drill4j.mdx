# Why use Drill4J

- Look at the [key differences of Drill4J from other technologies](/docs/overview/key-differences)
- Check out [ideas on how Drill4J might fit your project](/docs/overview/overview-ideas)

:::note
Drill4J is <b>flexible</b> - setup it for the backend, or just the frontend, or both. For all services, or just for one. <br/>
The same thing applies for integrating with tests - you can target manual tests, E2E UI test, API, or only one of these. <br />
