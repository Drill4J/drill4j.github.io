# What is Drill4J

Drill4J is an open-source tool[\*](#license) to identify testing gaps and reduce time spent on regression testing.

Drill4J provides you with a straight path to incorporate Test Gap Analysis and Test Impact Analysis into your SDLC.

- It integrates with all parts of system under test, including backend and frontend services.
- It tracks all types of tests, including automated and manual;
- It detects changes in application code;
- It tracks code execution in runtime.

Based on that Drill4J:

- shows code not touched by any tests. Both in percentage and down to exact place in code;
- detects risks - modified or new code which needs to be tested;
- recommends minimal and sufficient set of tests;
- tracks if tests really covered aformentioned risks;
- provides comprehensive metrics which can be easily integrated with Quality Gate with just a single API call.

All the above allows to speed up testing by eliminating guesswork and backing tests results with hard data.
