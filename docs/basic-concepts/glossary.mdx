# Drill4J Glossary

This section establishes meaning for both general terms used in this documentation and terms specific to Drill4J.

**It is written both as the introduction and as a basis for other parts of documentation, so it's highly advised to read it, before proceeding to the next sections.**

:::note
1.a **/** (forward slash) character in term definition means that terms are used interchangeably.

2.a word emphasized in _Italic_ implies this is a term defined in this glossary. Click to navigate to definition. If not available, try manual search.

## General terms

- **<i id="application">Application / Application Under Test / System Under Test</i>** - the complete system, which may include lots of parts, like backend service(s), web frontend, or be just one thing.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="general-service">Service</i>** - a distinct part of the [_Application_](#application). Examples: a monolithic backend service, a microservice, a web frontend.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-automated">Tests / Automated tests</i>** - are any kind of automated tests. Manual tests will be specifically referred as "_manual tests_".
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-api">API tests</i>** - tests which call API endpoints directly.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-ui">UI tests / E2E tests</i>** - tests which manipulate web browser, simulating user actions.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-manual">Manual tests</i>** - tests performed manually in the web browser.

:::note
Drill4J does not support desktop applications _at the moment_. For simplicity's sake it's assumed that "UI tests" means "WEB UI tests"

## Drill4J terms

### Components

This list is not exhaustive and intended for introductory use.

- **<i id="drill-instance">Drill4J instance</i>** - a collection of Drill4J components, mainly Admin Backend and PostgreSQL database, which stores the data about the [_Agents_](#agent). It also may include other components, depending on the setup.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="admin-ui">Admin Panel / Admin UI</i>** - a Drill4J's web UI
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="admin-backend">Admin Backend</i>** - the core Drill4J backend service which stores and processes information about all [_Agents_](#agent).
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="agent">Agent</i>** - a component or set of components responsible for **tracking code execution** during tests and reporting this data to [Admin Backend](#admin-backend).
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="agent-java">Java Agent</i>** - [native agent](https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent) for JVM based on [JVM TI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/) integrated with the target [_Service_](#general-service). It also has a corresponding [Agent entity](#agent-entity) within Drill4J Admin Panel
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Autotest Agent</i>** -
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Java Autotest Agent</i>** - specifically the Java autotest agent implementation.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Browser extension</i>** - a Drill4J's [Chrome Browser extension](https://github.com/Drill4J/browser-extension) for recording _Manual Tests_ coverage.
  <br />
  <br />

### Features

This section briefly defines terms for main Drill4J features

- **<i>Test-to-code mapping / test2code mapping</i>** - the association between [_Coverage_](#coverage) data and the particular _test context_ this data is received from.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="coverage">Coverage</i>** - **both** data on which probes were triggered and which were not **and** a $\frac {coveredProbes} {totalProbes}$ percentage calculated based on this data
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="risks">Risks</i>** - modified or new [_Methods_](#packages-classes-methods) detected in [_Build_](#build).
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Recommended tests / tests to run</i>** - a minimal set of [_Tests_](#tests) suggested by Drill4J that will allow to cover [_Risks_](#risks)
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Time savings</i>** -
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Quality gate</i>** -
  <br />
  <br />

### Internal

This section describes terms used specifically in Admin Backend and Admin Panel.

- **<i id="agent-entity">Agent</i>** - is an entity representing an individual [_Service_](#general-service) within Drill4J.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Service group</i>** - a group that includes multiple [_Agents_](#agent), which allows to record metrics for them at the same time. E.g. collecting metrics for [microservices](/docs/basic-concepts/microservices); collecting metrics for web frontend and Java backend.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Agent Registration</i>** - a one-time configuration process. Whenever the _Agent_, previously unknown to Drill4J, is added, user must navigate to _Drill4J Admin Panel_ and go through registration procedure.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="build">Build</i>** - is a concrete version of the [_Service_](#general-service), identified by _Build version_ string. _Build_ is always associated with the _Agent_.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="packages-classes-methods">Packages, Classes and Methods</i>** - for Java and JVM languages (as well as .NET) all these terms are exactly what they are.
  **However** for JavaScript/TypeScript these terms do not always make much sense. But to keep UI consistent, we stuck with these terms, with the [following caveats](/docs/basic-concepts/javascript-caveats)
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Probes</i>** - programmatic flags/counters placed in a code to track it's execution
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests">Tests</i>** - the set of tests which Drill4J recorded data about. It includes [_Test context_](#test-context) and the detailed [_Coverage_](#coverage) data for each [_package, class and method_](#packages-classes-methods). Notably, coverage data is stored separately for each test.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="test-context">Test Context</i>** - test's metadata, including but not limited to: test name, type, parameters, status, duration. Depending on the exact autotesting framework Drill4J extracts more or less additional information.
