## General terms

This section describes meaning behind general terms.
The goal is to avoid ambiguous wording.
These definitions do not claim absolute correctness outside of this documentation.

- **<i id="sut">System Under Test / SUT</i>** - the complete system which is being tested. It may be comprised of multiple components, or a single component.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="service">Service / Application</i>** - a distinct part of the [_SUT_](#sut). Examples: a monolithic backend service, a microservice, a web frontend.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-automated">Automated tests</i>** - are any kind of automated tests.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-api">API tests</i>** - tests which call API endpoints directly.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-ui">UI tests / E2E tests</i>** [\*](#ui-tests-note) - tests which manipulate web browser by simulating user actions.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-manual">Manual tests</i>** - tests performed manually in the web browser.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests-unit">Unit tests</i>** - tests which check isolated parts of a code.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="test-gap-analysis">Test Gap Analysis / TGA</i>** - the process of identifying parts of the codebase not covered by any test. Drill4J covers this area with the [_Coverage_](#coverage) and [_Risks_](#risks) features.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="test-impact-analysis">Test Impact Analysis / TIA</i>** - a process of speeding-up testing phase by understanding which tests should be run after a change to the production code. Drill4J achives that via [_test-to-code_](#test-to-code-mapping) mapping and [_test recommendations_](#recommended-tests).

<i id="ui-tests-note" />

:::note
\*Drill4J does not support desktop applications _at the moment_. For simplicity's sake it's assumed that "UI tests" means "WEB UI tests".

## Drill4J terms

### Components

This list is not exhaustive and intended for introductory use.

- **<i id="drill-instance">Drill4J instance</i>** - a collection of Drill4J components, mainly Admin Backend and PostgreSQL database, which stores the data about the [_Agents_](#agent). It also may include other components, depending on the setup.
  <br />
  <br />

  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="agent">Agent</i>**[\*](#note-on-agents) - a component (or set of components) responsible for **tracking code execution** during tests. Each such _Agent_ has a corresponding [_Agent_](#agent-entity) entity.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="autotest-agent">Autotest Agent</i>**[\*\*](#note-on-autotest-agents) - a component that **integrates with the testing framework**. Learn more in [data collection](/docs/basic-concepts/data-collection) section.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="browser-extension">Browser extension</i>** - a Drill4J's [Chrome Browser extension](https://github.com/Drill4J/browser-extension) for recording [_Manual Tests_](#tests-manual) coverage.
  <br />
  <br />

:::note
Don't get discouraged if something sounds a bit confusing at the moment and keep reading. The further sections will expand on terms and topics described here in greater detail.

<i id="note-on-agents"> </i>

> \* Note on agents
>
> - for Java/JVM applications agent is a [single component](https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent) which integrates with the target [_Service_](#service) through [JVM TI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/)
> - in case of Web JavaScript there are multiple components involved. See more in [JavaScript Implementation](/docs/advances/javascript-implementation) section.

<i id="note-on-autotest-agents"> </i>
<br />

> \*\* Note on autotest agents
>
> - for tests written in Java/JVM languages there is [Java Autotest Agent](https://github.com/Drill4J/autotest-agent) It as available both as a [Maven or Gradle plugin](/docs/installation/setup-java-autotests).
> - for tests written in JavaScript/TypeScript there is [a library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drill4j/js-auto-test-agent) which needs to be integrated with testing frameworks of choice
> - for POSTMAN tests there is a [cli wrapper](https://github.com/Drill4J/pwad)

### Features

This section briefly defines terms for main Drill4J features.

- **<i id="test-to-code-mapping">Test-to-code mapping / test2code mapping</i>** - the mapping data that shows **which tests executed which code, and visa-verse**. In the more technical terms, it is the association between [_Coverage_](#coverage) data and the particular [_Test context_](#test-context) this data is received from. Drill4J represents this in a two-way relation - see [methods tab](/docs/basic-concepts/admin-panel-basics#methods-tab) and [tests tab](/docs/basic-concepts/admin-panel-basics#tests-tab) in [Admin Panel Basisc](/docs/basic-concepts/admin-panel-basics) section.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="coverage">Coverage</i>** - data identifying to what extent [_packages, classes and methods_](#packages-classes-methods) were executed during tests. On a lower level it is the information on which [_probes_](#probes) were triggered (or "hit"). It is also the $\frac {coveredProbes} {totalProbes}$ percentage calculated based on this data. Refer to [Metrics Calculation](/docs/basic-concepts/metrics-calculation) and [Coverage Implementations](/docs/advanced/coverage-implementations) sections for in-depth explanation.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="risks">Risks</i>** - modified or new [_Methods_](#packages-classes-methods) detected in [_Build_](#build). Drill4J tracks if you actually covered these changes and reports the result via [_Quality Gate_](#quality-gate) API.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="recommended-tests">Recommended tests / tests to run</i>** - a minimal set of [_Tests_](#tests) suggested by Drill4J that will allow to cover [_Risks_](#risks).
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="quality-gate">Quality gate</i>** - a configurable set of conditions for [_Coverage_](#coverage) and number of not-covered [_Risks_](#risks). Allows to check if [_Build_](#build) meets target metrics such as: [_Coverage_](#coverage) percentage and number of [_Risks_](#risks).
  <br />
  <br />

### Internal

This section describes terms used specifically in Admin Backend and Admin Panel.

- **<i id="agent-entity">Agent</i>** - is an entity representing an individual [_Service_](#service) within Drill4J.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Service group</i>** - a group that includes multiple [_Agents_](#agent), which allows to record metrics for them at the same time. E.g. collecting metrics for [microservices](/docs/basic-concepts/microservices); collecting metrics for web frontend and Java backend.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i>Agent Registration</i>** - a one-time configuration process. Whenever the [_Agent_](#agent), previously unknown to Drill4J, is added, user must navigate to [_Admin Panel_](#admin-ui) and go through registration procedure.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="build">Build</i>** - is a concrete version of the [_Service_](#service), identified by _Build version_ string. _Build_ is always associated with the [_Agent_](#agent).
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="packages-classes-methods">Packages, Classes and Methods</i>** - for Java and JVM languages (as well as .NET) these are exactly what they sound like.
  **However** for JavaScript/TypeScript they do not make much sense. But to keep UI consistent, we stuck with them, with the [following caveats](/docs/basic-concepts/basics-javascript#caveats).
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="probes">Probes</i>** - programmatic counters which track code execution. The exact implementation differs depending on the platform, you can learn more in [Coverage Implementations](/docs/advanced/coverage-implementations) section.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="tests">Tests</i>** - the set of tests which Drill4J recorded data about. It includes [_Test context_](#test-context) and the detailed [_Coverage_](#coverage) data for each [_package, class and method_](#packages-classes-methods). Notably, coverage data is stored separately for each test.
  <br />
  <br />
- **<i id="test-context">Test Context</i>** - test's metadata, including but not limited to: test name, type, parameters, status, duration. Depending on the exact autotesting framework Drill4J extracts additional information.
  <br />
