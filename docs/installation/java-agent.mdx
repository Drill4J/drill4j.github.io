# Java Agent Configuration

Drill4J Java Agent is using [JVMTI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jvmti/) interface
to analyze and instrument _Application Under Test_(_AUT_) in runtime.

## Download

Java Agent has two parts two it - JVM in `.jar` and native in either `.dll` or `.so` depending on the platform. 

Pick the [platform appropriate release](https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent/releases) depending on where _Application Under Test_ runs:
- Currently Linux and Windows are supported 
- There are caveats to Alpine support


## Start the agent

You have to provide the following string to `java` command running your _Application Under Test_:

You can either directly bake it into `java` launch like that
```shell
java -agentpath:/data/agent/libdrill_agent.so=drillInstallationDir=/data/agent,adminAddress=wss://drill-admin:8090,agentId=my-app-backend,groupId=my-app-under-test,buildVersion=0.1.0,logLevel=INFO,packagePrefixes=io/spring -jar my-app.jar
# .so is for linux, swap for .dll if running under Windows
# ! IMPORTANT ! make sure to change value of packagePrefixes=io/spring to your application package prefix
#               separated by "/" instead of "."
#               example: your app consists of my.org.project.moon.user, my.org.project.moon.orders, my.org.project.moon.logic
#                        set package prefixes to my/org/project/moon
```

But more elegant and handier way is to use [JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/envvars002.html) env variable which is picked up by Java automatically
```
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentpath:/data/agent/libdrill_agent.so=drillInstallationDir=/data/agent,adminAddress=wss://drill-admin:8090,agentId=my-app-backend,groupId=my-app-under-test,buildVersion=0.1.0,logLevel=INFO,packagePrefixes=io/spring"
```

Using JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS option also allows to add Drill4J Java Agent to any Java app running inside Docker container __without alterting the image__.<br/>
This enables you to easily integrate Drill4J into __any testing environment seamlessly__ - no need to rebuild the image, no need to deploy separate env to collect metrics

## Delivery options

### Manual
You can simply download Drill4J Java Agent from its [github releases page](https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent/releases) and place them next to _App Under Test_ `jar`

### Docker Shared Volume 
When running under Docker it can be handier to use our small image, that runs a script to download these files into shared volume:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  
  # The sole function of this container is to download agent files
  # according to version specified in AGENT_VERSION env variable
  # and place them into volume named agent-files
  agent-files:
    image: drill4j/java-agent:latest
    environment:
      - AGENT_VERSION=${AGENT_VERSION} 
    volumes:
      - agent-files:/data

volumes:
  # you can attach this volume to your Application Under Test for ease of access to agent files
  agent-files:
```

### Kubernetes Init Container

When running in Kubernetes consider using [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
to download agent files [from github](https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent/releases) and make them available for pod running _App Under Test_

## Purpose 

Drill4J Java Agent is responsible for multiple tasks:

1. Analyze application's packages, classes, methods and send _metadata_ (not the actual code) to Drill4J Admin Backend
2. Instrument _AUT_ code to enable code execution tracking (in other words, code coverage)
3. Analyze incoming requests to extract tests context (supplied, for example, by either Drill4J Java Agent or Browser Extension)
