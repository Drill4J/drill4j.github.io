setup java agent

- **<i>Agent ID</i>** - a unique (within Drill4J [instance](/docs/basic-concepts/glossary#drill-instance)) string which identifies _Agent_.
  :::note
  Only lowercase latin characters, numbers and dashes ("-") are allowed. No spaces, no uppercase characters.

  <b>Good</b>: my-backend, my-frontend, fizbuz
  <br />
  <b>Bad</b>: MyBackend, myFrontend, Fiz Buz

- **<i>Build version</i>** - a unique (within the particular _Agent_) string which identifies the _Build_.
  For the convinience and readability sake it's better be the actual **version tag**. If it's not available, it may be unique string, which corresponds to the concrete version of the service under test (e.g. a hash of Git commit).
  See the [setup section](/docs/installation/setup) for the specific agent for more details.
