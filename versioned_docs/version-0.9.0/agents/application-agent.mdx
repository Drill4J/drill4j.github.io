# Application Agent

Drill4J Java Agent enables metrics collection for JVM-based applications.

General integration steps are:

1. [Download Drill4J agent files](#how-to-download)
2. [Set path to agent](#how-to-set-path-to-agent)
3. [Set agent parameters](#how-to-set-agent-parameters)

Due to the diverse tools used in software development — such as CI/CD providers, deployment methods, testing stages — the exact process will depend on the environment.

## How to download

### Download agent files manually

The most basic way to get agent files is to download release .zip manually.

1. Download release appropriate for your platform at  <https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent/releases/tag/v0.9.0>.

    > `mingwX64` is for Windows, Linux and Mac releases are called respectively.

2. Unzip the file. Rename unzipped folder to `agent`.

3. Inside you'll find the following files:

    -  `libdrill_agent.so` (on Windows - `.dll`, on Mac - `.dylib`)
    - `drill-runtime.jar`
    - `drill.properties`

Refer to [next section](/docs/agents/java-agent#how-to-set-path-to-agent) for further steps

### Use Docker image with a download script

> __Use case__: when you are already using Docker Compose to start your application.

We provide a small Docker image, that executes download script upon startup.

The way it works is:
1. You add our container to your docker-compose.yml file, passing the desired version to `JAVA_AGENT` env variable.
2. On startup, the container launches the download script.
3. Docker's healthcheck waits for it to complete.
4. Downloaded agent files are placed in a shared volume.
5. Shared volume is mounted to your application's container.

See the example [docker-compose.yml](/files/0.9.0/application-agent/download-agent-files.docker-compose.yml) file for details.

### Use Drill4J CI/CD Integration Plugin for Maven and Gradle

> __Use cases__: when application (or certain classes of application) is launched with Maven or Gradle. Thats most often the case with __Unit tests__.

Drill4J CI/CD Integration Plugin __automatically downloads agent files__ and __passes required parameters to Java__.

Because of that, the next sections of this page are irrelevant in this scenario. Instead, please refer to [CI/CD Integration Plugin](/docs/cicd-integration/cicd-integration-plugin) page for more info.

## How to set path to agent

Java allows to load agents using [special command line argument](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting):

```shell
java -agentpath:<path-to-agent>
```

Where `<path-to-agent>` must point to agent library file

There are two way to set this command line argument

### Pass `-agentpath:` directly to Java process

> __Use case__: when you have a direct access to __Java__'s process launch arguments. 

Considering your application is launched with

```shell
  java -jar my-app.jar
```

Change it to

```shell
  # Linux 
  java -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so -jar my-app.jar
  # Windows
  java -agentpath:/agent/drill_agent.dll -jar my-app.jar
  # macOS 
  java -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.dylib -jar my-app.jar
```

### Set `-agentpath` to `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` env variable

> __Use case__: when you don't have direct access to the __Java__'s process launch arguments. It's often the case when app is launched somewhere deep in scripts or inside Docker container.

Use [`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#tooloptions) to instruct __Java__ to use Drill4J Java Agent. Its a built-in env variable supported by any Java version

```shell
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so
  # Linux - libdrill_agent.so
  # Windows - drill_agent.dll
  # macOS - libdrill_agent.dylib
```

### Troubleshooting

To ensure you set agentpath correctly see [how to confirm agent is loaded](#how-to-confirm-agent-is-loaded) section below

## How to set agent parameters

Drill4J agent supports 3 ways to set agent [parameters](#agent-parameters-reference)

### Set parameters using environment variables

This is the recommended way to set agent parameters

Env variables names are prefixed with `DRILL_` with uppercase snake case. Examples:

- Given `packagePrefixes` parameter the env variable is `DRILL_PACKAGE_PREFIXES`

__Precedence__: parameter values set with env variables have the highest precedence and will override values set in `-agentpath` string or  `drill.properties` file

### Set parameters in `-agentpath` argument string

Append parameters to the `-agentpath` argument string. Add `=<options>` after `<path-to-agent>`:
```shell
-agentpath:<path-to-agent>=<options>
```

Example:
```
-agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so=parameter1=hello,parameter2=bar
```

Parameters are:
- passed after `<path-to-agent>` (`/agent/libdrill_agent.so` above)
- start of parameters string is indicated with `=` sign
- parameters are `<key>=<value>` pairs
- each pair is separated by comma

__Precedence__: parameter values set with `-agentpath` will override values set in `drill.properties`

### Set parameters in `drill.properties` file

Alternatively, Drill4J agent checks for values in `drill.properties` file. By default it is downloaded with agent files.

```
parameter1=hello
parameter2=bar
```

It adheres to the [properties file syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html)

__Precedence__: parameter values set in `drill.properties` file have the lowest precedence and can be overriden by `-agentpath` and env variables

## Agent parameters reference

| Parameter         | Required | Example Value                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                |

| packagePrefixes | yes | `my/org/somecoolapp`                                       | Specifies the packages for Drill4J to monitor. See [syntax and examples](#how-to-set-package-prefixes) below. |
| buildVersion    | recommended <br/> [see more](#considerations-regarding-buildversion-and-commitsha) | `v1.2.3`                                                   | Build version of your application. Typically set to version tag. |
| commitSha | recommended <br/> [see more](#considerations-regarding-buildversion-and-commitsha) | `8d87b0c2379a925...` | Full SHA hash of commit from which your application .jar is built from.  

### Env variables naming

Environment variables start with the prefix `DRILL_`, followed by the parameter name in `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`.

**Example**:
1. For `apiUrl`, the env var is `DRILL_API_URL`.
2. For `packagePrefixes`, the env var is `DRILL_PACKAGE_PREFIXES`.

### How to set package prefixes

__packagePrefixes__ is the filter that specifies which packages Drill4J should monitor. It is usually set to the topmost common package of your application.

Avoid setting it to something very broad (like `com` or `org`) - otherwise you will be scanning and collecting metrics for third-party dependencies.

#### Syntax

1. Parts of package names are separated with forward slashes `/` (and not dots `.`)
2. Multiple packages can be specified using `;` delimiter
3. To exclude package use `!` prefix

#### Example

Given you app packages are:

1. `my.org.somecoolapp.user`
2. `my.org.somecoolapp.orders.repository`
3. `my.org.somecoolapp.db.models`

__packagePrefixes__ parameter should be set to `my/org/somecoolapp`

#### Adding extra package

Add package name separated by `;` - `my/org/somecoolapp;some/other/package`

This adds both `my/org/somecoolapp` and `some.other.package` to scanned packages

#### Excluding package 

Add package name prefixed with `!` - `my/org/somecoolapp;!my.org.somecoolapp.db.models`

This adds `my/org/somecoolapp` to scanned packages, but excludes `my.org.somecoolapp.db.models`

### API key security

❗ Please avoid hardcoding __apiKey__ and exposing it in plain text. Instead, use environment variables. ❗

Bad example:
```shell
  -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so=drillApiKey=123
```

Good example:
```shell
  # Set DRILL_API_KEY variable prior to application launch
  DRILL_API_KEY=123
  # exact syntax for env variables will depend on your environment
```

### Considerations regarding `buildVersion` and `commitSha`

While `buildVersion` and `commitSha` are not strictly required, we recommend providing at least one (ideally both) for the following reasons:

1. It allows Drill4J to group metrics by version or commit.
2. Without `buildVersion` and `commitSha` Drill4J reports each application instance individually. Instances are identified with random UUID.

`buildVersion` typically corresponds to the version tag of your application.

Compliance with [Semver](https://semver.org/) is not required. Drill4J treats the build version as a unique string for grouping metrics, without any added semantics.

> **Q:** What if I don’t have build versions for development builds?
>
> **A:** You can omit this parameter. If you provide `commitSha`, Drill4J will still group metrics by commit.

## Troubleshooting

### How to confirm agent is loaded

Once loaded Drill4J agent prints the following ASCII logo:

```log
  ____    ____                 _       _          _  _                _      
  |  _"\U |  _"\ u     ___     |"|     |"|        | ||"|            U |"| u   
/| | | |\| |_) |/    |_"_|  U | | u U | | u      | || |_          _ \| |/    
U| |_| |\|  _ <       | |    \| |/__ \| |/__     |__   _|        | |_| |_,-. 
  |____/ u|_| \_\    U/| |\u   |_____| |_____|      /|_|\          \___/-(_/  
  |||_   //   \\_.-,_|___|_,-.//  \\  //  \\      u_|||_u          _//       
(__)_) (__)  (__)\_)-' '-(_/(_")("_)(_")("_)     (__)__)         (__)  
Java Agent (v0.9.0)
```
It indicates that you have configured agent path correctly and Java picked up and loaded agent files.

### Cannot load the agent because some agent parameters are set incorrectly

If below Drill4J ASCII logo you see the following message:
```
ERROR [com.epam.drill.agent.configuration.ValidatedParametersProvider] Cannot load the agent because some agent parameters are set incorrectly. Please 
check the following parameters:
```

It indicates that you are missing some required parameters. Refer to the [agent parameters](#agent-parameters-configuration-options) section.

## Limitations and Known Issues

1. While __x64__ Macs are supported, __ARM__ Macs (M-series Apple Silicon CPUs) are not yet supported; work is in progress.
