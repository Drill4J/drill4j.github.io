# Application Agent

Drill4J Java Agent enables metrics collection for JVM-based applications.

General integration steps are:

1. [Download Drill4J agent files](#how-to-download)
2. [Set path to agent](#how-to-set-path-to-agent)
3. [Set agent parameters](#how-to-set-agent-parameters)

Due to the diverse tools used in software development — such as CI/CD providers, deployment methods, testing stages — the exact process will depend on the environment.

## How to download

### Download agent files manually

The most basic way to get agent files is to download release .zip manually.

1. Download release appropriate for your platform at  <https://github.com/Drill4J/java-agent/releases/tag/v0.9.0>.

    > `mingwX64` is for Windows, Linux and Mac releases are called respectively.

2. Unzip the file. Rename unzipped folder to `agent`.

3. Inside you'll find the following files:

    -  `libdrill_agent.so` (on Windows - `.dll`, on Mac - `.dylib`)
    - `drill-runtime.jar`
    - `drill.properties`

Refer to [next section](/docs/agents/java-agent#how-to-set-path-to-agent) for further steps

### Use Docker image with a download script

> __Use case__: when you are already using Docker Compose to start your application.

We provide a small Docker image, that executes download script upon startup.

The way it works is:
1. You add our container to your docker-compose.yml file, passing the desired version to `JAVA_AGENT` env variable.
2. On startup, the container launches the download script.
3. Docker's healthcheck waits for it to complete.
4. Downloaded agent files are placed in a shared volume.
5. Shared volume is mounted to your application's container.

See the example [docker-compose.yml](/files/0.9.0/application-agent/download-agent-files.docker-compose.yml) file for details.

### Use Drill4J CI/CD Integration Plugin for Maven and Gradle

> __Use cases__: when application (or certain classes of application) is launched with Maven or Gradle. Thats most often the case with __Unit tests__.

Drill4J CI/CD Integration Plugin __automatically downloads agent files__ and __passes required parameters to Java__.

Because of that, the next sections of this page are irrelevant in this scenario. Instead, please refer to [CI/CD Integration Plugin](/docs/cicd-integration/cicd-integration-plugin) page for more info.

## How to set path to agent

Java allows to load agents using [special command line argument](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting):

  ```
  java -agentpath:<path-to-agent>=<options>
  ```
  - `<path-to-agent>` - must point to `libdrill_agent` file
  - `=` - delimiter between path to agent and agent options
  - `<options>` - parameters passed to the agent. These are described in the [next section](#agent-parameters-reference)

There are two way to set this command line argument

### Pass `-agentpath:` directly to Java process

> __Use case__: when you have a direct access to __Java__'s process launch arguments. 

Considering your application is launched with

```shell
  java -jar my-app.jar
```

Change it to

```shell
  # on Linux 
  java -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so -jar my-app.jar
  # on Windows 
  java -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.dll -jar my-app.jar
  # on Mac 
  java -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.dylib -jar my-app.jar
```

### Set `-agentpath` to `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` env variable

> __Use case__: when you don't have direct access to the __Java__'s process launch arguments. It's often the case when app is launched somewhere deep in scripts or inside Docker container.

Use [`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#tooloptions) to instruct __Java__ to use Drill4J Java Agent. Its a built-in env variable supported by any Java version

```shell
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so
  # adjust to .dll or .dylib depending on platform
```

### How to confirm that agent is loaded

Once loaded Drill4J agent prints the following ASCII logo:

```log
  ____    ____                 _       _          _  _                _      
  |  _"\U |  _"\ u     ___     |"|     |"|        | ||"|            U |"| u   
/| | | |\| |_) |/    |_"_|  U | | u U | | u      | || |_          _ \| |/    
U| |_| |\|  _ <       | |    \| |/__ \| |/__     |__   _|        | |_| |_,-. 
  |____/ u|_| \_\    U/| |\u   |_____| |_____|      /|_|\          \___/-(_/  
  |||_   //   \\_.-,_|___|_,-.//  \\  //  \\      u_|||_u          _//       
(__)_) (__)  (__)\_)-' '-(_/(_")("_)(_")("_)     (__)__)         (__)  
Java Agent (v0.9.0)
```
It indicates that you have configured agent path correctly

### Troubleshooting

If below Drill4J ASCII logo you see the following message:
```
ERROR [com.epam.drill.agent.configuration.ValidatedParametersProvider] Cannot load the agent because some agent parameters are set incorrectly. Please 
check the following parameters:
```

It indicates that you have to supply agent with parameters. Please refer to [agent parameters](#agent-parameters-configuration-options) section.

## How to set agent parameters

As described [above](#how-to-set-path-to-agent) parameters are:
- passed after `<path-to-agent>`
- start of parameters string is indicated with `=` sign
- parameters are `<key>=<value>` pairs
- each pair is separated by comma

> __Adressing possible confusion__: term `agent options` originates from [JVMTI docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting).
> 
> We prefer to call these `agent parameters`

Drill4J agent supports multiple ways to set agent parameters

### Pass parameters with `-agentpath` argument string

You can add parameters to the argument string like this:
```
-agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so=parameter1=hello,parameter2=bar
```

### Use `drill.properties` file

Alternatively, Drill4J agent checks for values in `drill.properties` file. By default it is downloaded with agent files.

It adheres to the [properties file syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23095_01/Platform.93/ATGProgGuide/html/s0204propertiesfileformat01.html)

Parameters set in `drill.properties` file have lower precedence and can be overwritten by parameters passed directly with `-agentpath` string.

| drillApiUrl     | yes | `http://localhost/api`      | URL to Drill4J Admin /api endpoint.                                                                                                                                         |
| drillApiKey     | yes | `1_01cdf51ff20544ee...`                                                | Drill4J Backend API key. Generate it using Drill4J UI. Please see [best practice](#how-to-set-drillapikey) for how to set drill api key                                                                                            |
| groupId         | yes | `my-cool-app`                                              | Unique arbitrary string identifying your application group.                                                                                                                |
| appId           | yes | `api-service`                                              | Unique arbitrary string identifying your application.                                                                                                                      |
| packagePrefixes | yes | `my/org/somecoolapp`                                       | Topmost common package of your application. For example, if your packages are `"my.org.somecoolapp.user"`, `"my.org.somecoolapp.orders.repository"`, `"my.org.somecoolapp.something.else"`, then set `packagePrefixes=my/org/somecoolapp`. |
| buildVersion    | no__*__ | `v1.2.3`                                                   | Build version of your application. Typically set to version tag. |
| commitSha | no__*__ | `8d87b0c2379a925...` | Full SHA hash of commit from which your application .jar is built from.  

__*__ while parameters __buildVersion__ and __commitSha__ are not strictly required but we still recommend to supply one or the other (or better - both) because:
1. It will allow Drill4J to group your application metrics by versions or commits.
2. Otherwise metrics for each application instance will be grouped into individual reports, without ability to merge

### Recommended Way to Set __drillApiKey__

❗ Avoid hardcoding __drillApiKey__ and exposing it in plain text. Instead, use the environment variables. ❗

Bad example:
```shell
  -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so=drillApiKey=123
```

Good example:
```shell
  # create DRILL_API_KEY variable in your environment beforehand
  # use this variable to substitute parameter drillApiKey value
  -agentpath:/agent/libdrill_agent.so=drillApiKey=$DRILL_API_KEY
  # exact syntax for env variables will depend on your environment
```

### Recommended way to set __buildVersion__ and __commitSha__

It is best to pass __buildVersion__ and __commitSha__ via env variables too. Thats because they likely will change for each deployment in your CI/CD environment, so it doesn't make sense to hardcode them in a launch script or set in `drill.properties` file.

## Limitations and Known Issues

1. While __x64__ Macs are supported, __ARM__ Macs (M-series Apple Silicon CPUs) are not yet supported; work is in progress.
