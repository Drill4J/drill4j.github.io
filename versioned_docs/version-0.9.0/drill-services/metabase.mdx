Metabase is a frontend service that provides configurable dashboards for displaying Drill4J's metrics.

## Installation
To install Metabase, follow the steps described in [local-deployment](/docs/getting-started/local-deployment).

## Configuration

Before you start using Metabase, you need to configure it. Here are the steps to do that:

### Setting Drill4J DB connection

Metabase uses the Drill4J database to fetch the data.
To set up the Drill4J database connection, follow these steps:

Click on the `Settings` icon in the top right corner and select `Admin settings`.

Move to the `Databases` menu on the header and click on the `Drill4J_PostgreSQL_DB` record.

Check the Database connection details and fix them if needed.

And click on the `Save changes` button.

### Setting Site URL

Metabase uses the Site URL to generate links to the dashboards.
To set the Site URL, follow these steps:

Click on the `Settings` icon in the top right corner and select `Admin settings`.

Move to the `General` tab and set the `Site URL` field.

## Authentication and Authorization

## Troubleshooting

1. I don't see the Metabase authentication form and instead presented with this message:
    ```
    "Welcome to Metabase - Looks like everything is working. Now letâ€™s get to know you, connect to your data, and start finding you some answers!
    ```
    - Reason: Metabase was not propertly initalized. You likely have either skipped downloading data.sql file or misplaced it. Make sure to put it in db-init folder next to the docker-compose.yml file.

2. Metabase widgets sometimes display correctly and sometimes show errors at random times.
   - The cause might be the inability to allocate shared memory to the PostgreSQL Docker container.
   To confirm the cause, you can check the Metabase logs and see an error like:
   ```
   pq: could not resize shared memory segment "/PostgreSQL.XXX" to XXX bytes: No space left on device
   ```
   To fix it ensure that you add `shm-size` parameter to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
     postgres:
       image: postgres:17.0
       shm_size: 1g
   ```
