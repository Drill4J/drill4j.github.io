## Recommended Tests

How it works (by example):
1. You have executed tests for version `0.1.0`.
2. In these tests, the `"Make Order"` test covered the method `Cart.addItem`.
3. The method `Cart.addItem` changed between two versions.
4. Based on this information, Drill4J suggests you execute the `"Make Order"` test again.
5. `"Make Order"` is _likely_ the best chance to test the changed method, though it is not guaranteed.
6. Let's say you execute this test, but now it's broken or insufficient. You'll notice this thanks to Drill4J's __Changed Or New Methods__ metric
