# What is Drill4J

Drill4J is designed to streamline __Test Gap__ and __Test Impact Analysis__.

It helps you identify testing gaps and reduce time on regression testing.

Supporting unit, integration, API, E2E UI, and manual tests, it:

- Detects code changes
- Tracks test execution
- Gathers detailed code coverage

Drill4J creates comprehensive reports highlighting __untested code__ and __recommends appropriate tests__.

By using Drill4J, you can accelerate development, eliminate guesswork, and back your testing results with concrete data.
