# What is Drill4J

Drill4J is the tool for __Test Gap and Test Impact Analysis__.

It enables you to __identify testing gaps__ and __reduce time spent on regression__ testing.

It supports __unit__, __integration__, __API__, __E2E UI__ and __manual__ tests.

Simply speaking:
- It detects changes in application code
- It tracks execution of tests
- And then tells you what you have missed and how you can test it!

All the above allows to speed up testing and development cycle, eliminate guesswork and back tests results with hard data.
