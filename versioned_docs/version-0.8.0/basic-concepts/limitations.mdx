# Limitations

## Only one "active" build

## Builds have to be "consequent" for risks detection to work properly

## **Before** deploying new _Build_ metrics collected for the previous one must be **saved**

In order to save coverage metrics you have to finish active scope
You have to save metrics by either makind an API call to Drill4J admin or clicking "Finish scope"
