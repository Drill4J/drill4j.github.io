How Drill4J allows to label, query and manipulate recorded data

When to use

- Different test types
- Different test owners
  - Monolithic app
  - Microservice app

What it allows for

- basic CRUD
- get a "cross-section" of increment
  - by owner
  - by type
  - by arbitrary data (e.g. sprint/release, feature, module, etc)
  - mix all of the above
