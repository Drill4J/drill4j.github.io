# Drill4J JavaScript Implementation

## Principle

- Js parser
  - Source code
  - Bundled code
  - Sourcemaps
- Java Script Agent
  - manual tests
  - automated tests
  - javascript-agent component

## Caveats

- Class - for JavaScript it refers to _the source file_.
- Package - is just the path to the source file in project tree.
- Methods - is either just a function (or actual method, it does not really matter for coverage)
