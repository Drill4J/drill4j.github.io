This page describes one time setup steps to start using Drill4Net to minimize your regression suite.
Once you performed these steps, you can move forward with <Link to="/docs/drill4net/quick-start-guide" target="_blank">quick start guide</Link>
or <Link to="/docs/drill4net/ci-cd-integration" target="_blank">CI/CD integration</Link>.

## 1. Install Drill4J Admin
First of all you need to install *Drill4J Admin*. Use <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4j-admin-installation" target="_blank">this guide</Link>
to install *Drill4J Admin*.

## 2. Configure Drill4Net Scanner
Download and configure *Drill4Net Scanner* as described <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-apps#drill4net-scanner" target="_blank">here</Link>.

<Info>
  NOTE <br/>
  If your application under test uses microservices architecture you should configure Drill4Net Scanner
  separately for each microservice. 
</Info>

## 3. Configure Drill4Net Injector
Download and configure *Drill4Net Injector* as described <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-apps#drill4net-injector" target="_blank">here</Link>.

## 4. Setup Application Under Test
Setup your application under test as described <Link to="/docs/drill4net/app-under-test-setup" target="_blank">here</Link>.

<Info>
  NOTE <br/>
  If your application under test uses microservices architecture you should perform setup
  for each microservice.
</Info>

## 5. Setup Project with Tests
Setup your project with tests as described <Link to="/docs/drill4net/tests-project-setup" target="_blank">here</Link>.

## 6. Run Drill4Net Scanner
After *application under test* build is finished, run Drill4Net Scanner as described <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-apps#4-usage" target="_blank">here</Link>.

<Info>
  NOTE <br/>
  If your application under test uses microservices architecture you should run Drill4Net Scanner
  separately for each microservice. 
</Info>

## 7. Register Agent in Drill4J Admin
<Info>
  NOTE <br/>
  If your application under test uses microservices architecture you should perform the following
  steps foreach microservice separately.
</Info>

1. After you launched *Drill4Net Scanner*, navigate to *Drill4J Admin UI*.
2. Click *Select Agent* --> *Add Agent*
3. You should see agent with name specified in `adminAgentConfig:id` earlier and .NET type.
If you are using microservices you will also see `adminAgentConfig:serviceGroupId`.
Click *Register*.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="monolith"
  values={[
    {label: 'Monolith', value: 'monolith'},
    {label: 'Microservices', value: 'microservices'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="monolith">
    <Image src="/img/drill4net/add-agent.png"/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="microservices">
    <Image src="/img/drill4net/add-agent-microservices.png"/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. Now you can see your agent information. Click *Next*.

5. Enter the *Target Host* on which your application will run and click *Next*. Example: http://localhost:5000.

6. Make sure *Test2Code* is checked and click *Finish*.
<Image src="/img/drill4net/agent-registration-03.png"/>
7. Now you can select newly created agent and go to *Test2Code*. You should see your class structure:
<Image src="/img/drill4net/test2code-01.png"/>
The full agent registration process should look like this:
