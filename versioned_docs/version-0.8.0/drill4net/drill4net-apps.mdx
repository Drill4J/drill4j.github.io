This web page provides an overview of *Drill4Net Scanner* and *Drill4Net Injector* applications,
their purposes, how to configure and utilize these applications for maximum benefit.
See <Link to="/docs/drill4net/quick-start-guide" target="_blank">quick start guide</Link> to learn how you can use these
applications together to minimize your regression suite.

## Drill4Net Scanner

### 1. Overview
*Drill4Net Scanner* is a console application developed to process *application under test* assemblies so that it will be
able to communicate with *Drill4J Admin*. *Drill4Net Scanner* is also responsible for collecting code coverage 
and all the required information for analyzing risks (methods changed sinse the last build) and tests that should
run to cover these risks.

### 2. Download
Download *Drill4Net Scanner (drill4net-scanner)* for your system [here](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases).

### 3. Configuration
*Drill4Net Scanner* application can be configured using appsettings.yml file which can be found in *Drill4Net Scanner* directoty.
Table below describes each setting.

<Table>

| Setting                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **adminAgentConfig:id**                                       | Arbitrary agent name. Example: "test_app_1". If you are using microservices architecture you will need to run Drill4Net Scanner for each microservice and provide config value for each of them.   |
| **adminAgentConfig:serviceGroupId**                           | Arbitrary microservices group identifier to group microservices together. Example: "group_1". Leave this value blank if you are not using microservices architecture.                              |
| **adminAgentConfig:buildVersion**                             | Version of the build. Should be updated for every new build. Example: "0.0.1".                                                                                                                     |
| **communicatorUrl**                                           | Communication URL of Drill4J Admin back-end.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **coverageCollectionSettings:  schedulerDelayInterval**       | Interval in seconds indicating how often code coverage data is sent to the Drill4J Admin. The default value is 10 seconds.                                                                         |
| **coverageCollectionSettings:  collectInitProcessesCoverage** | Specifies whether to collect coverage for initial processes (Background jobs, Initialization, Cron). The default value is false.                                                                   |

</Table>

Example of the *Drill4Net Scanner* appsettings.yml:
```
adminAgentConfig:
  id: 'appId-1'
  serviceGroupId: ''
  buildVersion: '0.0.1'
communicatorUrl: 'http://localhost:8090'

coverageCollectionSettings:
  schedulerDelayInterval: 10 
  collectInitProcessesCoverage: false
```

### 4. Usage
You can run *Drill4Net Scanner* as you would run any other console application.
There are two required arguments:
- Directory with binaries of application under test
- Application under test executable (`--target`)
Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Scanner.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1" \
  --target "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\ApplicationUnderTest.exe"
```

There are also optional parameters described <Link to="/docs/drill4net/drill4net-scanner-parameters" target="_blank">here</Link>.

<Warning>
    Make sure not to move source files between the <i>_application build_</i> step and the <i>_Scanner_</i>'s launch<br/>  
    Why is it important:<br/>
    1. The Scanner application utilizes Coverlet to collect code coverage.<br/>
    2. Coverlet relies on Program Database Files (PDB).<br/>
    3. These PDB files contain the original paths for project sources.<br/>
    4. Therefore, if you change the source files location after the <i>_application build_</i> step, Scanner won't be able to locate sources and won't work properly
</Warning>

## Drill4Net Injector

### 1. Overview
*Drill4Net Injector* is a console application developed to process *assemblies with tests* so that it will be able
to send all the required information about tests to Drill4J Admin.

### 2. Download
Download *Drill4Net Injector (drill4net-injector-app)* for your system [here](https://github.com/Drill4J/dotnet-releases/releases).

### 3. Configuration

*Drill4Net Injector* application can be configured using drill4netsettings.yml file which can be found in *Drill4Net Injector* directoty.
Table below describes each setting.

| **Serilog:***                       | Logger settings. Detailed information about Serilog configuration is available [here](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration). Note: not all settings are available as we may not have required Serilog package for specific functionality. |

</Table>

Note that values of `AdminAgentConfig:Id`, `AdminAgentConfig:ServiceGroupId`, `AdminAgentConfig:BuildVersion` and
`CommunicatorUrl` should be same as in appsettings.yml of <Link to="#3-configuration" target="_blank">Drill4Net Scanner</Link>.
Example of the drill4netsettings.yml:
```
Settings:
  Client: HttpClient
  TestAssemblySourcePath: d:\Builds\AppUnderTest.Tests\netcoreapp3.1\AppUnderTest.Tests.dll

Serilog:
  Using:
    - Serilog.Sinks.Console
    - Serilog.Sinks.File
  MinimumLevel: Debug
  WriteTo:
    - Name: Console
    - Name: File
      Args:
        path: Logs/Drill4Net.Injector.App_.txt
        rollingInterval: Day

AdminAgentConfig:
  Id: 'appId-1'
  ServiceGroupId: ''
CommunicatorUrl: 'http://localhost:8090'
```

### 4. Usage
You can run *Drill4Net Injector* as you would run any other console application. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe
```
You can also provide `TestAssemblySourcePath` argument. In this case, value from drill4netsettings.yml will be overriden. Example for Windows:
```
start Drill4Net.Injector.App.exe "d:\Builds\AppUnderTest.Tests\netcoreapp3.1\AppUnderTest.Tests.dll"
```
